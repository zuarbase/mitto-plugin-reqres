## Introduction

This file is `mitto-plugin-reqres/docs/srcp/index.md`.  These contents are the
default placed here when the project was created with cookiecutter.  It is the top-level
private document page for the project.  If present, `srcp` should contain *private*
documentation, intended to be available only within Zuar.  It can contain any Markdown
and reST documentation desired.

When published, the HTML content created by the `srcp` directory will be available in
