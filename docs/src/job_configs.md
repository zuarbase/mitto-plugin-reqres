# Job Configuration

.. note:: The files contained in this document are located in the
   ``reqres/conf`` directory.  That directory is not accessible by
   Sphinx documentation.  To work around this, a symbolic lik is
   created at ``docs/src/conf`` that points to ``../../reqres/conf``.
   The ``literalinclude`` reST directives below access the files via
   the link.

This note presents a couple of example job configurations.

   .. literalinclude:: conf/unknown.hjson

.. admonition:: Job Configuration - Users
   :class: dropdown

   .. literalinclude:: conf/users.hjson
         :linenos:
