# Mitto Plugin ReqRes

Welcome to the documentation for `mitto-plugin-reqres` (ReqRes).  The
structure and initial content of this Mitto plugin was created with
`cookiecutter-mitto-plugin`.  It was then revised to contain basic
documentation for the plugin.

[REQ|RES](https://reqres.in) is a free service that allows the
testting of arbitrary REST API requests and responses.
`mitto-plugin-reqres` is an example of an extremely simple
Mitto plugin using `REQ|RES`.

The example plugin contains:
* documentation
  * directly authored (e.g.: this page)
  * automatically generated from code (e.g.: [todo](todo.md))
* a `wizard` that provides a user interface within the Mitto user
  interface that enables the user to easily create jobs using
  ReqRes
* an `inputter` that, when called from within a Mitto job
  configuration, will issue REST API calls to `https://reqres.in` and
  return  the data for processing by the remaining steps in the Mitto
  job
* simple tests for the implementation

## Table of Contents

* [REQ|RES](reqres.md)

* [Inputters](inputters.md)
