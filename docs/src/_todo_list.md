## TODO

`todo_list.md` contains the reST directive `.. todolist::`, which is
replaced by all todo items in the package, both source code and
documentation. This file `_todo_list.md` is a catch-all for todo
items.  It is never explicitly rendered as part of the documentation,
but the items here will appear in `todo_list.html`.

These items could be included in `todo_list.md`, but then they would
appear twice on that page.

.. todo::

   May want to provide documentation for these topics:

   * how to build the plugin
   * how to build the documentation (breifly covered in 
     [index-original.md)(index-original.md)
   * how to install the plugin

.. todo::

   Other stuff that would be nice:

   * cleanup/simplify `docs/conf.py`
   * inhibit sphinx warnings
   * modify CSS to enlarge font size
